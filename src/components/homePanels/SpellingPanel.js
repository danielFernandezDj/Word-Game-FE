        <br />

        <div className="text-justify m-auto max-w-xl">
          <p><strong>1- Starting a Game:</strong> Each round begins by listening to the word and reading its definition.</p>
          <p><strong>2- Entering Your Guess:</strong> Type your guess for the word in the input field.</p>
          <p><strong>3- Feedback:</strong></p>
          <p className="indent-4">
            <strong>* Correct Guess:</strong> If you guess the word correctly, your score will increase, and you move to the next word.
          </p>
          <p className="indent-4">
            <strong>* Incorrect Guess:</strong> If you guess wrong, you lose one of your 5 hearts.
          </p>
          <p><strong>4- Winning: </strong> You win by guessing 10 words correctly before running out of hearts.
            If you lose all 5 hearts, the game ends.
